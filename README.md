***For Apple Chip Users (M1/M2)***: You may need to install Rosetta 2 to run pre-compile binaries from our test cases. To install it from a terminal, you may try this command:
``/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license``

Our next few labs may require the `pwntools` package. You can install it by reading the installation document listed below. Some labs also require ***proof of work (PoW)*** before accessing the lab servers. Please read the PoW document to see how it works.
